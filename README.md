## Dynamic landing page project "ðŸŽ¯ Daily Focus"

:computer: **My goal** was to make a landing page with the time that we can interact with saving our name/focus to local storage.

In this project, I built landing page with the time and it's gonna change the greeting and the background image based on the time of day, if it's morning ðŸŒž, afternoon â›… or night ðŸŒ’. You're also gonna be able to add your name dynamically and then down it says what is your focus today so you could put in your focus and if you reload that's gonna stay there because you're gonna store it in local storage basically in the browser.
